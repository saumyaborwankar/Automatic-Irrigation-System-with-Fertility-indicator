# Automatic-Irrigation-System-with-Fertility-indicator
India is a country of agriculture and water is of the utmost importance in India, people can't rely on the rains for their primary water supply so there is need for innovation in the field of agriculture. Development in the field of irrigation of water in farms is the new direction for engineers, 
So here i have created a smart and useful project that would help out the farmers of india and it is a project which does not require much techinal knowledge for the farmer to know. it's very user friendly and very easy to implement. 
The difficult task comes when there is need for checking the fertility of the soil.
Every technical aspect of the project is described in a pdf file named
This project is implemented on Arduino Uno board.
